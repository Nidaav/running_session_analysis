# Running Session Analysis

# Welcome !

This project is a data visualization dashboard designed to analyze your training activities from CSV files.

It also contains feedback on your last session, areas for improvement to help you achieve your goals as a trail runner, and a draft training plan that you could have as an premium customer.

This guide will walk you through cloning the repository, installing dependencies, and launching the application locally.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the application, you'll need Git and Node.js installed on your system.

### Prerequisites

Please ensure you have the following software installed:

1. **Git** (for cloning the repository)
2. **Node.js** (version 16 or newer is recommended) and **npm** (Node Package Manager).

You can check your Node.js and npm versions by running these lines in a terminal :

**Bash**

```
node -v
npm -v
```

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Create a new folder called “**Running Session Analysis**”, then right-click and select “**Open in Terminal**.”
If you have **Visual Studio Code** installed, you can right-click and select “**Open with Code**” (this option is usually hidden in “Show more options” if you are using Windows 11).
This will allow you to view the code used to create this React application.

Once the terminal is open (or Command Prompt/PowerShell), run the following commands to clone the project:

**Bash**

```
# Clone the repository from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/Nidaav/runnin_session_analysis.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd running_session_analysis
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Once you are inside the running_session_analysis folder, use npm to install all necessary project dependencies (as listed in `package.json`):

**Bash**

```
npm install
# OR (if you prefer Yarn)
# yarn install
```

This process may take a minute or two.

### Step 3: Run the Application

After the installation is complete, you can start the application in development mode:

**Bash**

```
npm start
# OR (if you prefer Yarn)
# yarn start
```

The application will automatically open in your default web browser at:
🌐 [http://localhost:3000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:3000)

It should only take a minute to load...

Enjoy viewing your session data and receiving feedback on this session and your training beliefs !
